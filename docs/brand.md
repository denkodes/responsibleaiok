# Brand & Content Guidelines

## Core Identity
**Responsible AI OK** is a philanthropic-grade civic initiative. We are "Institutional, Educational, and Community-Rooted."
We avoid:
- "Tech Bro" hype or neon aesthetics.
- "Doomer" alarmism.
- Corporate sterility.

## Color System
Our palette is derived from the "Green Country" implementation of the Tulsa flag concepts but abstracted for professional/institutional trust.

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Deep Teal-Navy | `#112A46` | Headings, heavy backgrounds, primary brand anchors. |
| **Secondary** | Muted Blue-Green | `#4A7C8F` | Accents, icons, secondary buttons. |
| **CTA / Warmth** | Warm Gold/Amber | `#D0A03C` | Call-to-action buttons *only*. Never for large backgrounds. |
| **Background** | Off-White | `#FAF9F6` | Main page background. Never pure white `#FFFFFF` unless for card surfaces. |
| **Text** | Slate | `#334155` | Body copy. |

## Typography
**Font Family:** Inter (Variable).
**Headings:** Inter Display (Bold/Black). Tight tracking (`-0.04em`).
**Body:** Inter. Relaxed leading (`1.6`).

## Copy Rules
1. **No Overclaims:** We do not regulate. We do not have "national authority" yet. We are a *local* initiative connected to national networks.
2. **Staged Maturity:** Explicitly distinguish between what we do NOW (workshops, convening) and what we do LATER (curriculum, deeper governance).
3. **Tone:** Calm, authoritative, invitational. "Preparedness" over "Safety". "Guidance" over "Governance".

## Component Rules
- **Buttons:** Pill-shaped or rounded-lg. Primary CTA is Gold. Secondary is potentially outlined Teal.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use sparingly. Only for content cards on complex backgrounds (if any). Prefer clean surfaces.
- **Shadows:** Soft, tinted with navy. No harsh blacks.
